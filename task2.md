## Task 2 - Deploying a Web App on Azure

### üîß Tool/Command Used:
Azure Portal, Azure App Service, Azure CLI, .NET CLI

### üìò Explanation:
This task covers deploying a simple web application using Azure App Service. The steps include creating the web app via Azure Portal, writing and running a sample .NET application, publishing the app, and finally accessing it via the public Azure URL. Azure CLI and .NET CLI were used for deployment and publishing, while the Portal helped manage the service. The goal is to demonstrate how to deploy a web app on Azure, including setting up the environment, writing the application, and deploying it to the cloud. This task is crucial for understanding how to deploy web applications on Azure, a key skill for cloud computing professionals.
