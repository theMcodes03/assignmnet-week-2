## Task 1 - Azure Linux VM Setup with SSH and GUI Access

### üîß Tool/Command Used:
Azure Portal, Azure CLI, SSH, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), XRDP, XFCE4

### üìò Explanation:
This task involves provisioning a Linux virtual machine in Azure, enabling secure SSH access, installing a desktop environment (XFCE4), and setting up remote GUI access using XRDP and RDP. Azure CLI was used to open the required ports for RDP access.
